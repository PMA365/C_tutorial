## <h1 align="center"> Language Operators</h1>



Here are all the operators in the C programming language:

**Arithmetic Operators**
------------------------

1. `+` (addition)
2. `-` (subtraction)
3. `*` (multiplication)
4. `/` (division)
5. `%` (modulus)
6. `++` (increment)
7. `--` (decrement)

**Assignment Operators**
-----------------------

1. `=` (assignment)
2. `+=` (addition assignment)
3. `-=` (subtraction assignment)
4. `*=` (multiplication assignment)
5. `/=` (division assignment)
6. `%=` (modulus assignment)
7. `<<=` (left shift assignment)
8. `>>=` (right shift assignment)
9. `&=` (bitwise AND assignment)
10. `^=` (bitwise XOR assignment)
11. `|=` (bitwise OR assignment)

**Comparison Operators**
-----------------------

1. `==` (equal to)
2. `!=` (not equal to)
3. `>` (greater than)
4. `<` (less than)
5. `>=` (greater than or equal to)
6. `<=` (less than or equal to)

**Logical Operators**
--------------------

1. `&&` (logical AND)
2. `||` (logical OR)
3. `!` (logical NOT)

**Bitwise Operators**
--------------------

1. `&` (bitwise AND)
2. `^` (bitwise XOR)
3. `|` (bitwise OR)
4. `~` (bitwise NOT)
5. `<<` (left shift)
6. `>>` (right shift)

**Member Access Operators**
---------------------------

1. `.` (member access)
2. `->` (member access through pointer)

**Other Operators**
-------------------

1. `,` (comma operator)
2. `sizeof` (sizeof operator)
3. `&` (address-of operator)
4. `*` (dereference operator)
5. `()` (function call operator)
6. `[]` (array subscript operator)

Note that some of these operators have higher precedence than others, and some have different associativity (i.e., whether they evaluate from left to right or right to left).
